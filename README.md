## Description

EventHub is your reliable assistant in creating the perfect event in just 5 minutes.
For event organizers, it offers an intuitive personal account with a full set of functions
for quick customization. For guests, it provides convenient interaction with the application
through Telegram Mini Apps (TMA).

## This project is in development phase

We utilize FastAPI with FastAPI-Keycloak-Middleware for secure authentication via Keycloak,
ensuring API protection and access control, thus making the application user-friendly.
